# ar_tracker_tensorflow
## Introduction
### Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze the possibility of using TensorFlow as an ar tag tracker, so it can be used as a sensor for an autonomous navigation rover.
This project is relevant, because even if there are technologies that can perform this task, they canâ€™t be used in low end computers neither be trained to identify new ar tags. 
### Project requirements 
- The project must be able to recognize the followings ar tags provide by ROS package [ar_track_alvar](http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar)
![ar tags]( http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=markers0to8.png)

- Must be compatible with the technologies used by the team EagleX Robotics so it can be used in an autonomous navigation rover.
 	- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
	- [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic)
	- Python/C
- Must be able to be executed in a Raspberry pi 4 8 Gb RAM
- Must have the following performance
	- Low latency
	- Hight Precision
	- Low Recall is acceptable
## Installation 
### Requirements
